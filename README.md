One Shot Traps was going to be a 3D 3rd person shooter arcade game in which the player has to
shoot traps in order to kill enemies. But since I've quit the jam, it just stayed as a
prototype. (https://irisgamedev.itch.io/one-shot-traps)


I made it for the HYPLAY Indie Galactic #2 Jam (https://itch.io/jam/hyplay-jam-2).
The game had to run on a web, had to have a high score and implement the "one shot" theme.

The theme made think about "killing 2 birds with one shot", so my idea was to make a shooter game
in which the player has to shoot to traps in order to activate them and so kill as much enemies
as possible.
